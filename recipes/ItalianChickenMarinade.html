    <li>
        <ul>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon garlic powder</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon salt</ul>
        <ul>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</ul>
    </li>

    <p>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
        Whisk salad dressing, garlic powder, and salt together in a shallow baking dish; add chicken breasts and turn to coat. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.
        
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
        
        <strong>Step 3</strong>
        Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade.
        
        <strong>Step 4</strong>
        Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 7 to 8 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
