        <ul>2 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped</ul>

        <ul>1 teaspoon ground cumin</ul>
        <ul>½ teaspoon chili powder</ul>
        <ul>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</ul>
        <ul>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</ul>
        <ul>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</ul>

        <strong>Step 1</strong>
        Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.
        
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
        Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.
        
        <strong>Step 3</strong>
        Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.
        
        <strong>Step 4</strong>
        Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.

        <strong>Step 5</strong>
        Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.

        <strong>Step 6</strong>
        Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well. Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring. Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.
